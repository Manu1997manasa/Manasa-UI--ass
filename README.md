## Task 1 - Node.js

In this task, we set up a basic Node.js server using the Express.js framework. The server listens on port 3000 and responds with "Hello, World!" for the root URL.

## Task 2 - AngularJS

For this task, we create a simple AngularJS application that allows users to add items to a list. The application consists of an index.html file and an app.js file defining an AngularJS controller.

## Task 3 - JavaScript

In this task, we write a JavaScript function that calculates the sum of an array of numbers. The function is tested with sample arrays to ensure its correctness.

## Task 4 - TypeScript

Here, we create a TypeScript class representing a car. The class has properties for make, model, and year, along with a method to get a formatted string representation of the car's details. The class is tested with a sample car instance.
